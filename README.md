# Bitdegree-Responsive-Web-Development-Section-1

I learned the following features in this project.

  1-  Relative measurements allow us to size the content relative to other elements on the page.
  2-  The unit of em - sizes font size relative to the parent element.
  3- The unit of rem - sizes font size relative to the root (<html>) element.
  4-  Percentages (%) are used to size the features like height, width, borders, padding or margin.
  5-  When we use percentages (%) to size the width and height of elements, child elements are sized relative to the dimensions of the parent. Don't forget to set the dimensions of the parent first!
  6-  Percentages (%) are also used for padding and margin. We set both horizontal and vertical padding and margin relative to the width of a parent element.
  7-  The maximum and minimum width of elements are set using max-width and min-width.
  8-  The maximum and minimum height of elements are set using max-height and min-height.
  9-  When we have set the height of media elements like image or audio, we can set their width automatically so that element can scale without overflow. 
 10-  When we set 'background-size: cover;', a background image of an HTML element will scale proportionally.
